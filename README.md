#Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application developed using Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, and MongoDB. It provides a robust framework for user authentication and authorization, allowing you to easily implement access control in your projects.

Features
Authentication: Email and password authentication using Passport.js. OAuth integrations (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) can be added as needed.
Authorization: Secure role-based access management to control user permissions.
MVC Architecture: Organized code structure using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
Database Integration: User data stored securely in MongoDB with Mongoose as the ORM.
Session Management: Implements session-based authentication for a secure and persistent user experience.
Scalable Design: Can be customized for any web application requiring authentication and authorization.
